At Gusto we like writing tests to verify that our code works as expected.
Suppose we expect the result of some calculation to be a specific key-valued structure, such as:

```
expected = {
  id: 9876,
  first_name: 'Tony',
  last_name: 'Soprano',
  account: {
    bank_name: 'Bank Of America',
    account_number: 12345
  }
}
```

But the actual result of the calculation was:

```
actual = {
  id: 20,
  first_name: 'Tony',
  account: {
    account_number: 12345,
    balance: 500
  }
}
```

We would like to be able to compare the two structures in our tests, and know what
were the specific differences between them. Write a helper, which is given two inputs
(actual and expected), and outputs a list of all the diffs between them, using the
following github-esque format:

```
[
  [ '-', 'id',                  9876              ],
  [ '-', 'last_name',           'Soprano'         ],
  [ '-', 'account.bank_name',   'Bank Of America' ],
  [ '+', 'id',                  20                ],
  [ '+', 'account.balance',     500               ]
]
```
