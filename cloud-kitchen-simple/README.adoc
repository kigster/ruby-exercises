== Problem Definition

We've captured the constraints and requirements of the xref:PROBLEM.adoc[problem in this document].

== Using It

=== Requirements

 * Ruby 2.7+ is ideal, but Ruby 2.6+ is accepted.

=== Running via the Script

Top level folder has a BASH script `./run.sh`. Go ahead and run it:

[source,bash]
bash ./run.sh

The script does the following steps:

 * Validates the Ruby version is at least 2.6+=
 * Installs Bundler gem
 * Installs the rest of the dependent Ruby Gems
 * Runs RSpec with Test Coverage
 * Runs Rubocop
 * Finally, starts the `exe/kitchen` binary dispatcher using the `spec/fixtures/orders.json` file.

=== Running Ruby Executable Directly

To run ruby executable please ensure that all dependencies above are installed, and then

[source,bash]
----
bundle install
bundle exec exe/kitchen spec/fixtures/orders.json
----

You should see trhe following output:
